# Background information

The growth of microbes must consume nutrients (substrates) and transform those nutrients into products, conserving energy from the transformation. These transformation, to date must be atomically and electronically conserved, resulting in overall reaction stoichiometries of substrate and products involved for energy conservation (catabolic reactions) and biomass production (anabolic reactions). Across the tree of life, macromolecule atomic and electronic (degree of reduction) composition are fairly conserved. Therefore, to constrain the contribution of component populations in a microbial community, the catabolic reactions provide a primary target for quantification.
